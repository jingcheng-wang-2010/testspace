/* Cash Register
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.
cid is a 2D array listing available currency.
The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.
Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.
Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.
Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.
